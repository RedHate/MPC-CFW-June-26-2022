# HAKAI MPC Custom Firmware

MPC software 2.11.2
Force software 3.1.1.3
Ultros / Zangetsu 2021/2022

Control interface still doesn't work for MPC Live 2 when in force mode (as far as i know) feel free to try it, you can reinstall a stock rom or optionally not use the
force software.

Only tested on MPC-One so far... again use at your own risk.
By now those who are going to use this will know how to use it... instructions shishsmuctions. Figure it out bud.

Download the parts, unzip, copy the file to your usb or sd card and install via the settings menu.

From a PC name a usb drive or SD card FORCE all capitals. When you insert this card and power the unit on or click "new project" it will load into akai force mode.
